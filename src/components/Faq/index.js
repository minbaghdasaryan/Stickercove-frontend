        Size is limited to this to retain legability and ensure a clean cut
        around the sticker.

        <span>Question:</span> Do the stickers leave a residue?
      </div>
      <div>
        <span>Answer:</span> Our stickers will not leave a residue on fabric.
        However, if the sticker is applied to a flat, smooth surface for an
        extended period of time a slight film will be left behind. This can
        easily be removed with an all purpose cleaner.
